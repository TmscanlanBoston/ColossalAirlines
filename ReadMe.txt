CIT-249 Java Programming Summer 2014
Thomas Scanlan

Project Description:

Final project for the course that required us to use what we had learned throughout the semester 
	about object oriented programming, file io, etc. 

This program could actually print a boarding pass in the right CS department classroom. 
I serialized my objects and wrote them to a file since I thought serialization was an interesting topic 
	and I wanted to try it out. 

See my screenshots, and you may notice I went crazy with the colors. This was my first time 
working with a UI and I really wanted to experiment with it.
